## Abstract

This report presents the implementation of a microservices architecture utilizing an API Gateway pattern with service discovery capabilities. The system demonstrates the fundamental principles of distributed computing by implementing two independent microservices (Users Service and Products Service) that register themselves with a centralized service registry (Consul). An API Gateway serves as the single entry point, dynamically routing client requests to appropriate services based on URL patterns. This implementation showcases key concepts including service registration, health monitoring, request routing, and system resilience in a microservices ecosystem.

│  Requests   │    │   (Port:     │    │    (Consul)     │    │   Instance   │
│             │    │    8080)     │    │   (Port: 8500)  │    │              │
└─────────────┘    └──────────────┘    └─────────────────┘    └──────────────┘
                           │                                           │

## 4. Steps Taken

### 4.1 Environment Preparation

1. **Go Installation:** Verified Go version 1.18+ installation
2. **Consul Installation:** Installed HashiCorp Consul via Homebrew
3. **Project Initialization:** Created project directory structure
4. **Dependency Management:** Initialized Go modules for each service

### 4.2 Service Implementation

#### 4.2.1 Users Service Development

```bash
cd services/users-service
go mod init users-service
go get github.com/go-chi/chi/v5
go get github.com/hashicorp/consul/api
```

Key implementation features:

- HTTP server setup with Chi router
- Consul service registration with unique service ID
- Health check endpoint implementation
- Graceful error handling and logging

#### 4.2.2 Products Service Development

Similar implementation to Users Service with different:

- Service name: "products-service"
- Port assignment: 8082
- Endpoint paths: `/products/{id}`

#### 4.2.3 API Gateway Development

```bash
cd api-gateway
go mod init api-gateway
go get github.com/hashicorp/consul/api
```

Core functionality implementation:

- Request path parsing and validation
- Service discovery via Consul Health API
- HTTP reverse proxy configuration
- Dynamic request forwarding

### 4.3 Service Discovery Integration

#### 4.3.1 Service Registration Logic

```go
registration := &consulapi.AgentServiceRegistration{
    ID:      fmt.Sprintf("%s-%s", serviceName, hostname),
    Name:    serviceName,
    Port:    servicePort,
    Address: "localhost",
    Check: &consulapi.AgentServiceCheck{
        HTTP:     fmt.Sprintf("http://localhost:%d/health", servicePort),
        Interval: "10s",
        Timeout:  "1s",
    },
}
```

#### 4.3.2 Service Discovery Implementation

```go
services, _, err := consul.Health().Service(name, "", true, nil)
if len(services) == 0 {
    return nil, fmt.Errorf("no healthy instances found")
}
service := services[0].Service
```

### 4.4 System Deployment and Testing

1. **Consul Startup:** `consul agent -dev`
2. **Service Deployment:** Sequential startup of microservices
3. **Gateway Deployment:** API Gateway initialization
4. **Functional Testing:** End-to-end request validation
5. **Resilience Testing:** Service failure and recovery validation

---

## 5. Challenges Encountered and Solutions

### 5.1 Hostname Resolution Challenge

#### 5.1.1 Problem Description

Initial service registration used system hostname (`wangs`) for both service address and health check URLs. Consul's health checker failed to resolve the hostname, resulting in critical health status.

**Error Message:**

```
"Status": "critical",
"Output": "Get \"http://wangs:8081/health\": dial tcp: lookup wangs: no such host"
```

#### 5.1.2 Root Cause Analysis

The issue stemmed from DNS resolution limitations in the development environment where the system hostname was not resolvable by Consul's health checking mechanism.

#### 5.1.3 Solution Implementation

Modified service registration to use `localhost` instead of hostname:

**Before:**

```go
Address: hostname,
HTTP: fmt.Sprintf("http://%s:%d/health", hostname, servicePort),
```

**After:**

```go
Address: "localhost",
HTTP: fmt.Sprintf("http://localhost:%d/health", servicePort),
```

#### 5.1.4 Impact Assessment

This solution resolved the health checking issue while maintaining service discovery functionality in the local development environment.

### 5.2 Port Conflict Management

#### 5.2.1 Problem Description

During iterative testing, services occasionally failed to start due to port binding conflicts from previous instances.

**Error Message:**

```
Failed to start server: listen tcp :8081: bind: address already in use
```

#### 5.2.2 Solution Strategy

Implemented systematic port cleanup procedures:

```bash
lsof -ti:8081 | xargs kill -9
lsof -ti:8082 | xargs kill -9
lsof -ti:8080 | xargs kill -9
```

### 5.3 Service Discovery Timing Issues

#### 5.3.1 Problem Description

Intermittent failures occurred when the API Gateway attempted to discover services before health checks had sufficient time to register as passing.

#### 5.3.2 Solution Implementation

- Implemented proper startup sequencing
- Added appropriate delays for health check stabilization
- Enhanced error handling in service discovery logic

## 6. Testing and Validation

### 6.1 Functional Testing

#### 6.1.1 Individual Service Testing

```bash
# Users Service Direct Access
curl http://localhost:8081/users/123
# Expected: Response from 'users-service': Details for user 123

# Products Service Direct Access
curl http://localhost:8082/products/abc
# Expected: Response from 'products-service': Details for product abc
```

#### 6.1.2 API Gateway Integration Testing

```bash
# Users Service via Gateway
curl http://localhost:8080/api/users/123
# Expected: Response from 'users-service': Details for user 123

# Products Service via Gateway
curl http://localhost:8080/api/products/abc
# Expected: Response from 'products-service': Details for product abc
```

### 6.2 Service Discovery Validation

- Verified service registration in Consul UI (http://localhost:8500)
- Confirmed health check status transitions from critical to passing
- Validated service deregistration upon process termination

### 6.3 Resilience Testing

#### 6.3.1 Service Failure Simulation

```bash
# Terminate Users Service
lsof -ti:8081 | xargs kill -9

# Test Gateway Response
curl http://localhost:8080/api/users/123
# Expected: Service unavailable error
```

#### 6.3.2 Service Recovery Validation

```bash
# Restart Users Service
cd services/users-service && go run . &

# Wait for health check stabilization (15 seconds)
sleep 15

# Test Gateway Response
curl http://localhost:8080/api/users/123
# Expected: Successful response from restarted service
```

## 8. Critical Analysis

### 8.1 Strengths

1. **Loose Coupling:** Services are completely independent with no direct dependencies
2. **Dynamic Discovery:** No hardcoded service locations in the API Gateway
3. **Health Monitoring:** Automated health checking with service registry integration
4. **Resilience:** System continues operating when individual services fail
5. **Observability:** Comprehensive logging and monitoring through Consul UI

### 8.2 Areas for Improvement

1. **Load Balancing:** Current implementation uses first-available strategy; could benefit from more sophisticated algorithms
2. **Security:** No authentication or authorization mechanisms implemented
3. **Configuration Management:** Hardcoded configuration values should be externalized
4. **Error Handling:** Could benefit from circuit breaker patterns for enhanced resilience
5. **Monitoring:** Additional metrics collection and alerting capabilities needed for production use

### 8.3 Production Readiness Assessment

While the current implementation demonstrates core microservices principles, several enhancements would be required for production deployment:

- SSL/TLS encryption for service communication
- Service mesh integration for advanced networking features
- Container orchestration with Kubernetes or Docker Swarm
- Centralized logging and distributed tracing
- Comprehensive testing suite including integration and load testing
